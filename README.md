Hello everyone, my name is Alsello Diveni Manuputty. I am a Chemical Engineering graduate with a comprehensive background in Process Optimization, Data Analysis, and Problem-Solving. 
Leveraging a Chemical Engineering degree and a completed Hacktiv8 Data Science Training Program, I am well-equipped to seamlessly transition into the role of a data scientist. 
Adept in Python programming, proficient in statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques, with a focus on deep learning modeling. 
Eager to apply a diverse skill set and a strong analytical mindset to deliver data-driven solutions as part of a dynamic data science team.

# Data Science Portfolio Projects

Here are the list of the projects I have done from the beginning of my transition to Data Science in May 2023 when I started the Data Science bootcamp. Please be advised that it's still in Bahasa Indonesia and will be updated soon. Thank you!

### Project 1 - X App Sentiment Analysis using Deep Learning NLP Method

**Description:** 
This is the first project I have ever done using NLP Deep Learning Method. In this project I used it to do a sentiment analysis on the recent public hearing regarding alien existence announcement. 
For the test data I extracted related tweets from X app using scrapping method. I also used Kaggle Dataset as a training data for the model.  My goal was to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual responded positively, negatively or keeping neutrality on the case.

# Introduction
Hello everyone, my name is Alsello Diveni Manuputty. I am a Chemical Engineering graduate with a comprehensive background in Process Optimization, Data Analysis, and Problem-Solving. 
Leveraging a Chemical Engineering degree and a completed Hacktiv8 Data Science Training Program, I am well-equipped to seamlessly transition into the role of a data scientist. 
Adept in Python programming, proficient in statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques, with a focus on deep learning modeling. 
Eager to apply a diverse skill set and a strong analytical mindset to deliver data-driven solutions as part of a dynamic data science team.

# Data Science Portfolio Projects

Here are the list of the projects I have done from the beginning of my transition to Data Science in May 2023 when I started the Data Science bootcamp. Please be advised that it's still in Bahasa Indonesia and will be updated soon. Thank you!

### Project 1 - X App Sentiment Analysis using Deep Learning NLP Method

**Description:** 

This is the first project I have ever done using NLP Deep Learning Method. In this project I used it to do a sentiment analysis on the recent public hearing regarding alien existence announcement. 
For the test data I extracted related tweets from X app using scrapping method. I also used Kaggle Dataset as a training data for the model.  My goal was to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual responded positively, negatively or keeping neutrality on the case.

### Project 2 - A DL Implementation on a Subscription-based Vegetable E-Commerce Churn Prediction

**Description:** 

In the rapidly growing world of e-commerce, subscription-based models have gained immense popularity due to their convenience and cost-effectiveness. This project focuses on implementing a Deep Learning (DL) solution for churn prediction in a subscription-based vegetable e-commerce platform. The aim is to help the business identify and retain customers who are likely to churn, thereby increasing customer retention rates and profitability.

### Project 3 - Credit Card Default Prediction using Classification ML Models

**Description:** 

Credit card default prediction is a critical task for financial institutions to minimize risks and manage their portfolios effectively. This project aims to develop and deploy a machine learning solution for credit card default prediction using a variety of classification algorithms. By leveraging historical credit card transaction data, customer profiles, and repayment behavior, this project helps identify customers who are at high risk of defaulting on their credit card payments.

### Project 4 - New York AirBnB Detailed Data Analysis with Dashboard

**Description:** 

New York City is one of the most popular destinations for Airbnb travelers, offering a wide range of accommodations. This project presents a comprehensive analysis of New York Airbnb data, aiming to uncover valuable insights into rental trends, pricing strategies, and customer preferences. The project also includes the development of an interactive Tableau dashboard for visualizing and exploring the data, making it accessible to a wider audience.

### Project 5 - Credit Cardholer Segmentation using Clustering Unsupervised ML

**Description:** 

Credit cardholder segmentation is a crucial task for financial institutions to tailor their services, marketing strategies, and risk management. This project focuses on utilizing unsupervised machine learning techniques to cluster credit cardholders based on their spending behavior, credit history, and other relevant features. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments within the credit cardholder population.
